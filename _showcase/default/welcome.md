    <h2>Welcome to My Academic Homepage!</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        This website showcases my research in causal discovery, large language models (LLMs), and time series analysis. I created this site to share my latest publications, projects, and collaborations in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can explore the <code>Publications</code> section to find my recent papers, including works presented at EMNLP, NeurIPS, and UAI, as well as ongoing projects in collaboration with LG AI Research and other institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also introduce my patent contributions, funded research projects, and academic journey through this site. This homepage is designed to help connect with fellow researchers, collaborators, and anyone interested in AI and causal inference.
